# ActiveDirectoryAttackTool


ActiveDirectoryAttackTool (ADAT) tool is used to assist CTF players and Penetration testers with helpful commands to run against an Active Directory Domain Controller. This tool is best utilized using a set of known working credentials against the host.
<br/>

# Usage: General

Standard usage
```
bash ADAT.sh -u ViperOne -p Password123 -t 10.10.10.100 -d Security.local
```
<br/>

Usage with LDAP base search
```
bash ADAT.sh -u ViperOne -p Password123 -t 10.10.10.100 -d Security.local -l "DC=Security,DC=Local"
```
<br/>

Usage with GitHub for script repositories (Target system has internet access)
```
bash ADAT.sh -u ViperOne -p Password123 -t 10.10.10.100 -d Security.local
```
<br/>

# Usage: Systems with no internet access
If the system you are testing has no internet access or is a CTF machine, ADAT will download the required GitHub repositories to your attacking system. Ensure you specify the ```-L``` parameter and set both the LocalIP and LocalPort variables within the script to that of your attacking system.
```
bash ADAT.sh -u ViperOne -p Password123 -t 10.10.10.100 -d Security.local -L
```
<br/>

# Usage: Standalone Windows Systems

Usage for non domain joined systems, whilst not officially supported by ADAT, many of the commands can be run against a standalone Windows system.
```
bash ADAT.sh -u ViperOne -p Password123 -t 10.10.10.100 -d . -L
bash ADAT.sh -u ViperOne -p Password123 -t 10.10.10.100 -d WORKGROUP -L
```
<br/>

# Usage: Null Mode

If you do not have any valid credentials for the system you are testing against, null mode can be utilized to help identify information where credentials may not be required.
```
bash ADAT.sh -t 10.10.10.100 -d Security.local -N
```
